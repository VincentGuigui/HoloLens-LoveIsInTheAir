# HoloLens-LoveIsInTheAir

HoloLens sample for putting floating text and 3D objects in the room.

This sample is being used as a sandbox for a new HoloLens ObjectManipulation component merging TapToPlace and HandDraggable behaviours.

HandDraggable has the following features:
- Hologram position persistence (WorldAnchorManager)
- Hand draggable
- Gaze draggable (tap to place)
- Hybrid manipulation : by Gaze then Hand for precise manipulation
- Position : Free or SpatialMapping alignment or hybrid
- Orientation : Facing User or SpatialMapping Normal

In the future, we may add Scale and Rotation features.
